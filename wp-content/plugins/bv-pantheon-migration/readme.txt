The easiest way to migrate your site to Pantheon

== Description ==

Pantheon is a website management platform that is the best place to run your WordPress site — hands down. And migrating your WordPress site doesn’t get any easier than with Pantheon Migrations.

With this plugin forget the headaches of manually migrating your site. All you need to activate the plugin is administrative access to your WordPress site. Just copy and paste your SFTP credentials from your new Pantheon site to the Pantheon Migrations tab in your WordPress Dashboard and click “migrate”. You can get back to work on other projects, and our migrations team will email you when everything is complete.

For full instructions please see our [docs page](https://pantheon.io/docs/migrate-wordpress/) on Pantheon Migrations.

Shout out to [BlogVault.net](https://blogvault.net/) for the development and hand in creating this plugin. By using this plugin you are agreeing to their [Terms of Service](https://blogvault.net/tos)


== Installation ==

= There are two methods = 

1. Upload `bv-pantheon-migration` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Once the plugin is activated, click on Pantheon Migration in the left side navigation

Enter the required information:

`Destination URL:` (this will be your pantheon address you are migrating to, example: http://dev-sitename.pantheon.io)
`Machine Token:` (Machine tokens are used to uniquely identify your machine and securely authenticate via Terminus)

Click the `Migrate` button and you will be redirected to the migration landing page. The plugin will automatically verify your Machine Token and let you know if there are any issues.

After the migration is complete there will be a button you can click to see the results of your migration and automatically redirected to your Pantheon site URL.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 1) I do not have a Pantheon account, can I still use this plugin? = 

No, but signing up for a Pantheon account is free and so is migrating your site with Pantheon Migrations. [Sign up here!](https://pantheon.io/register)

= 2) What information will the plugin ask for? =

You will have to provide the plugin your destination url and Machine Token from your Pantheon account. Please read the [Installation section](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bv-pantheon-migration/installation/) for more information on where to find this.

= 3) Why do you need my email? =

We require an email address to send you updates on the migration process, notify you of any errors that occur during the migration.

= 4) Is Multisite supported with this plugin =

Not yet, Pantheon is currently working on testing the support of Multisite on our platform but it's still too soon. We will update this section when it's available.

= 5) How long does it take to migrate a website? =

This can range anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours depending on the size of the website. On average, migrations to Pantheon take about 1 hour. 

= 6) Can I migrate a site from WordPress.com? =

Currently you can only migrate a self hosted WordPress installation, the plugin does not support migrating from WordPress.com.

= 7) What happens if I run into an error after the migration is complete? =

We are always wanting to assist and help out in any way that we can. If you encounter any type of issue please use the support section of our plugin. [Click here](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/bv-pantheon-migration/) to file an issue. `This section is monitored daily.`

= 8) Do I need to leave the window open while the migration is processing? =

No, that's the beauty of this plugin. It runs on a SAAS based technology and a secure web address that runs everything in the background. Once you start the migration you can close the window at any time and come back to it later while it's still running, no need to wait for hours. You will also receive an email once the migration has completed.
